# Multivariate-Control-Chart
Multivariate quality control refers to the statistical techniques used to monitor and control  processes involving multiple interrelated quality characteristics. These techniques are  essential in situations where variables are correlated and cannot be adequately assessed  using individual univariate tools. 

#  Multivariate Control Charts in R

This project explores **Multivariate Statistical Process Control (MSPC)** using R, highlighting techniques like **Hotellingâ€™s TÂ² chart** and **Multivariate EWMA (MEWMA)** to monitor processes involving correlated quality variables.

##  Why This Project?

In real-world manufacturing and service processes, multiple quality characteristics often behave **together**, not in isolation.

Traditional univariate control charts (like XÌ„-bar charts) can **miss joint shifts** or give **false alarms**. This project shows how **multivariate charts** can:

 Detect subtle, joint shifts in multiple variables  
 Monitor both large and small changes  
 Avoid misleading interpretations

## ðŸ”§ Techniques Covered

###  1. **Hotellingâ€™s TÂ² Control Chart**
- Monitors **mean vector** of multivariate processes.
- Sensitive to large shifts.
- Applied on the `Ryan92` dataset (Phase I and Phase II).
- Outlier detection and data cleaning demonstrated.

###  2. **MEWMA Chart**
- Detects **small or gradual shifts** better than TÂ².
- Tracks weighted history of data.
- Includes side-by-side comparison with Hotellingâ€™s TÂ².

###  3. **Control Ellipses**
- Visualizes 2D control regions.
- Used to show differences between independent and correlated variables.

## ðŸ“¦ R Packages Used

| Package | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `mvtnorm` | Simulate multivariate normal data |
| `qcc` | Construct TÂ² and univariate XÌ„-bar charts |
| `ellipse` | Draw control region ellipses |
| `Hotelling` | Classical multivariate tests |
| `MASS` | MEWMA simulation |
| `IAcsSPCR` | Real datasets for Phase II analysis |

---

##  Datasets

- **Ryan92**: Classical example from Montgomery's SQC book.
- **Simulated Phase II data**: Created using multivariate normal distribution to illustrate control in practice.

##  Example Output

###  Detecting Missed Shifts

> ðŸ”¹ Univariate chart showed X2 out of control  
> ðŸ”¹ Hotellingâ€™s TÂ² revealed points 10 & 20 were also problematic  
> ðŸ”¹ After cleaning, only subgroup 6 was flagged â†’ cleaner model

###  MEWMA Advantage

> ðŸ”¹ After a small mean shift, TÂ² missed the change  
> ðŸ”¹ MEWMA detected it quickly â†’ useful for real-time Phase II control

## ðŸ—‚ How to Use

To run the project:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the `.R` script in RStudio
3. Install required packages:
```r
install.packages(c("mvtnorm", "qcc", "ellipse", "MASS", "Hotelling", "IAcsSPCR"))

4. Run the script block-by-block to generate charts and observe results.

## ðŸŽ¯ Takeaways

This project demonstrates the power of **multivariate quality control** in:

 Identifying hidden correlations  
 Preventing false alarms  
 Detecting subtle but important process shifts

It reinforces how essential **Hotelling's TÂ²** and **MEWMA** charts are for industries like electronics, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing where multiple quality variables matter simultaneously.

##  Real-World Relevance

>  Example: In electronics manufacturing, monitoring only the **line width** or **etch depth** separately may miss early signs of defect.  
> But with **multivariate control charts**, subtle shifts in multiple dimensions can be caught before costly failures.

This makes MSPC crucial for **predictive quality assurance** in modern systems.
